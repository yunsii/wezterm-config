# Tmux UI

Use this doc when you need visible UI behavior for tabs, panes, or status lines.

## Tab Behavior

- The native Windows title bar stays hidden.
- The tab bar uses the non-fancy style and remains visible at the bottom.
- The tab bar uses padded labels and stronger background highlighting for hover and active tabs rather than explicit separator characters.
- The left side of the tab bar shows the current workspace as a tinted badge that sits flush against the tab strip.
- Managed project tabs use stable project directory names as titles.
- If a managed tab has multiple panes, the title prefers a short summary such as `project +1`.
- Unmanaged tabs fall back to working-directory-based title inference.

## Tmux Behavior

- tmux status follows the active pane working directory.
- `default` stays the built-in WezTerm workspace at the top level, but in `hybrid-wsl` its WSL tabs start inside a lightweight tmux session.
- Managed workspace creation only requires `default_domain` in `hybrid-wsl` mode.
- Managed tmux flows do not require shell rc `OSC 7` integration; tmux status and tmux-owned shortcuts resolve cwd from tmux's own `pane_current_path`.
- In tmux-backed panes, navigation actions such as VS Code open and worktree switching resolve through tmux first, including copy-mode and scrollback.
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` opens a centered tmux popup command palette whenever the current pane is running tmux.
- tmux refresh is command-palette-owned instead of WezTerm-shortcut-owned.
- `Ctrl+k` is a tmux chord prefix for memorized low-latency actions such as `Ctrl+k v` for vertical split and `Ctrl+k h` for horizontal split.
- After `Ctrl+k`, tmux temporarily replaces one status line with a generic waiting hint.
- Copy and paste are intentionally split by layer: tmux owns pane-local text selection and copy, while WezTerm owns the smart system clipboard paste path.
- tmux explicitly uses `set-clipboard external`, so copying from tmux copy-mode writes to the system clipboard through OSC 52.
- Outside tmux copy-mode, plain left clicks are consumed by tmux only to focus the pane under the mouse.
- Outside tmux copy-mode, plain left drag does not start any selection path; use `Shift+drag` to start tmux pane-local selection from normal mode.
- Wheel scrolling may move tmux into its copy-mode-backed scrollback state, and tmux selects the pane under the mouse before entering that state.
- Releasing the mouse after a drag does not auto-copy or auto-cancel.
- `Ctrl+c` is uniform inside tmux copy-mode: when a selection is present it copies without leaving copy-mode; without a selection it cancels copy-mode.
- This config does not expose a normal WezTerm cross-pane drag-selection path by default; terminal-wide selection is still available when you hold `SUPER`.
- `Ctrl+c` first checks for a WezTerm terminal selection and copies it if one exists; otherwise it sends a normal terminal `Ctrl+c`.
- tmux emits terminal focus-in and focus-out events to applications, which helps mouse-aware TUIs recover cleanly when the WezTerm window regains focus.

## Status Lines

- The first tmux line renders repo, branch, combined git change counts, tracked-branch sync markers, and Node.js version.
- The second tmux line renders the repo family's linked worktree count plus the current worktree role, for example `linked:2 · primary`.
- The worktree line derives its repo family and current role from the active pane's live git state instead of stored tmux metadata.
- The third tmux line renders whenever the WakaTime toggle is enabled.
- Any enabled status section keeps a stable on-screen slot. If live data is unavailable, that section renders placeholder text instead of disappearing.
- A section only disappears completely when its toggle is disabled. If an entire line has no enabled sections, that line does not reserve a status row.
- Node.js version lookup includes an `nvm` fallback and the resolved version is cached.
- WakaTime refresh is cache-backed and reuses summary data for up to 60 seconds.

## Notes

- `default` is not managed by `workspaces.lua`; it remains WezTerm's built-in workspace even though `hybrid-wsl` now boots its WSL tabs through a lightweight tmux session.
- `Alt+p` uses WezTerm's built-in relative workspace switching, so it includes `default`.
- Worktree switching stays inside one repo-family tmux session and updates the active tmux window instead of spawning more top-level WezTerm tabs.
- tmux status refresh is hybrid: the draw path reads cached lines, focus and pane or window change hooks trigger debounced background refreshes, and a 30-second `status-interval` acts as a low-frequency fallback poll.
- WakaTime status sources `wezterm-x/local/shared.env`, and WezTerm Lua also reads that same file for shared scalar values.
